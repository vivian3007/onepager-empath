        <p>
            For TLE 1 (Taylored Learning Environment 1), we worked on a project in a team.
            We had to find a solution for a problem that our client, Jan Dirk de Jong, had.
            At-risk-youth and their psychologists are often not on the same wavelength and this causes a lot of miscommunication and arguments between them.
            Me and my team tried to find a solution for this problem.
            First, we did our research and then we started designing.

        <p>
            We had a couple of ideas, but eventually we all agreed on one.
            We were going to make a game where the player could play as an at-risk-kid.
            They would get an entire storyline with situations and in every situation, they would have 3 choices.
            Each choice leads to another situation and eventually you would get to the end of the storyline.
            Every time you make different choices, you would get a different ending as well.
            When you're done playing, you can save your outcome.
            It is the intention that both the kid and the psychologist play this game, so they can discuss it.
            This way, there is less judgement from the psychologist towards the kid and their conversations are a lot more equivalent.

            We were able to make a prototype of this game.
            We added a timer and we wrote 3 different storylines.
            Here's a video of the prototype, where I show one of the stories:

            We made a productvideo to explain our product a little bit better.
